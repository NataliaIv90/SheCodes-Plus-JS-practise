        Include the JavaScript file provided in your project, when loading your
        project, ask the user "Enter a city" (example: Paris), alert "It is
        currently 19°C (66°F) in Paris with a humidity of 80%"
      </p>
      <p>
        If the city doesn't exist in the object (i.e: Sydney), alert "Sorry, we
        don't know the weather for this city, try going to
        https://www.google.com/search?q=weather+sydney". Since this is an alert,
        the link shouldn't be clickable.
      </p>
      <p>Add this behavior to your project and submit the CodeSandbox URL</p>
      <p>
        Note: Please round the values in the Alert to the nearest whole number
        (no decimal points, e.g. 5.45 should be rounded to 5).
